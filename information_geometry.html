This short course is provided by Professor Ting-Kam Leonard Wong of University of Toronto, Canada.<br><br>

 <b> <font size="3">Abstract:</font></b> <p style="width: 50%;">Information geometry is the geometric study of statistical manifolds which are spaces of probability
 or nonnegative measures. It originated from statistical inference and has been applied in diverse fields including
 statistical physics and machine learning. This short course is an introduction to information geometry and some of
 its recent developments. Mathematical prerequisites such as differential geometry and convex analysis will be 
 introduced as needed. In the first part, we will introduce statistical manifolds, divergence functionals and the 
 induced dualistic geometry. In the second part, we will discuss some relations between information geometry and optimal transport.</p><br><br><br>
