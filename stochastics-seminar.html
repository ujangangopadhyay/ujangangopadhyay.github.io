<b>Title:</b> Liouville quantum gravity, Liouville first-passage percolation
 and Watabiki's conjecture</br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Subhajit Goswami, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Liouville
first-passage percolation (LFPP) which is a model for random metric on
the plane or a finite planar grid graph. It is studied primarily as a
way to understand the random metric associated with Liouville quantum
gravity (LQG). In short, the Liouville quantum gravity is a one
parameter family of ``canonical'' random metrics on the plane. I will
discuss a result on the estimates of the typical distance between two
points and its implication for the Hausdorff dimension of the LQG
distance. I will highlight how this estimate refutes a conjecture made
in the physics literature about the LQG distance.</br></br></br></br></br>

<b>Title:</b> Logarithmic divergences: optimal transport and information geometry</br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Ting-Kam Leonard Wong, University of Toronto</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Divergences such as Bregman and Kullback-Leibler divergences are 
fundamental in probability, statistics and machine learning. We begin by 
explaining how divergences arise naturally from the geometry of optimal 
transport. Then, we study a family of logarithmic costs - originally 
motivated by financial applications - which may be regarded as a canonical 
deformation of the negative dot product in Euclidean quadratic transport. 
It induces a logarithmic divergence which has remarkable probabilistic and 
geometric properties. As an application, we introduce a generalization of 
continuous-time mirror descent.</br></br></br></br>

<b>Title:</b> An elementary proof of phase transition in the planar XY model.</br></br>
  
<b>Speaker:</b> Marcin Lis, University of Vienna</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Using elementary methods we obtain a power-law lower bound on the two-point
function of the planar XY spin model at low temperatures. This was famously first rigorously
obtained by Fr√∂hlich and Spencer and establishes a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase 
transition in the model. Our argument relies on a new loop representation of spin correlations,
a recent result of Lammers on delocalisation of integer-valued height functions, and classical 
correlation inequalities. This is joint work with Diederik van Engelenburg.</br></br>

<b>Title:</b> Fractal Geometry of the KPZ equation</br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Promit K. Ghosal, MIT</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a fundamental stochastic
PDE related to the KPZ universality class. In this talk, we focus on how the tall 
peaks and deep valleys of the KPZ height function grow as time increases. In particular, 
we will ask what is the appropriate scaling of the peaks and valleys of the (1+1)-d KPZ 
equation and whether they converge to any limit under those scaling. These questions will 
be answered via the law of iterated logarithms and fractal dimensions of the level sets. 
The talk will be based on joint works with Sayan Das and Jaeyun Yi. If time permits, I will 
also mention an ongoing work with Jaeyun Yi for the (2+1)-d case.</br></br></br></br>

<b>Title:</b> What are logarithmically correlated random fields? </br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Christian Webb, University of Helsinki </br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Logarithmically correlated fields are stochastic processes whose covariance has a logarithmic singularity
on the diagonal. In the past few decades, it has been discovered that such objects play an important role in various
probabilistic models ranging in areas ranging from number theory and random matrix theory to quantum field theory 
and random PDEs. In this talk, I will describe what these objects are and what kind of role they have played in various 
recent research questions.</br></br></br></br>

<b>Title:</b> Ranking and matching in statistical network models</br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Cheng Mao, Georgia Tech</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Finding latent structures in networks is an important task 
in many fields of science and engineering. For a variety of problems, the 
task can be formulated as inferring a latent permutation of vertices of a 
network from noisy data. Problems in this class are often computationally 
infeasible in the worst case due to the combinatorial nature of permutations, 
so statistical methods are essential for inference in large-scale networks. 
This talk will provide an overview of two problems: ranking items from comparisons
and matching correlated networks. For each problem, I will introduce an 
average-case model and the associated task of learning a latent permutation. 
Then I will discuss recent development of efficient algorithms that come with 
theoretical guarantees.</br></br></br></br>

<b>Title:</b> Integrability of boundary Liouville CFT</br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Guillaume Remy, Columbia University</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Liouville theory is a fundamental example of a conformal 
field theory (CFT) first introduced in physics by A. Polyakov to describe
a canonical random 2d surface. In recent years it has been rigorously studied 
using probabilistic techniques. In this talk we will take a look at the 
integrable structure of Liouville CFT on a domain with boundary by proving 
exact formulas for its correlation functions. We will also discuss the connection 
with the conformal blocks of CFT which are fundamental functions determined by 
conformal invariance that underlie the exact solvability of CFT. Based on joint 
works with Morris Ang, Promit Ghosal, Xin Sun, Yi Sun and Tunan Zhu.<br><br><br><br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Souvik Dhara, MIT <br><br>
 
<b>Title:</b> Fine structure of large networks: Universality phenomena,
asymptotic characterization, and modern issues<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will discuss some recent challenges arising
in the study of large and complex networks. Over the last decades,
improved data collection methods have significantly increased the
availability of empirical data on networks, and the study of networks
has become relevant across multiple disciplines such as biology,
computer science, physics, and statistics. This has stimulated
enormous activity in the mathematics research community to understand
(1) local and global structure of networks, (2) dynamic processes on
them, and (3) algorithms to discover hidden patterns in networks. In
this talk, I will discuss my research on the above three topics in the
context of percolation process, graph limits, and community detection
on networks.<br><br><br><br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Konstantin Matetski, Columbia University <br><br>
 
<b>Title:</b> KPZ universality of random growing interfaces<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> The KPZ universality class includes random growing 
interfaces, which, after rescaling, are conjectured to converge to the
KPZ fixed point. The latter is a Markov process, which has been
characterized through the exact solution of TASEP, a particular model
in the class. The KPZ equation plays a special role and is conjectured
to be the only model connecting the Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) and
the KPZ fixed points. In the talk, I will introduce the KPZ fixed
point and review recent work on the KPZ universality done by myself
and my collaborators.<br><br><br><br>

<li> December 1, 2021, 04:00 PM Singapore time.<br><br>

<b>Speaker</b>: Pierre-Francois Rodriguez, Imperial College, London.<br><br>

<b>Title</b>: Recent progress on near-critical percolation for the 3D Gaussian free field<br><br>

<b>Abstract</b>: I will report on recent progress regarding the near-critical behavior of certain statistical 
  physics models in dimension 3. Our results deal with the critical scaling exponents associated to the 
  second-order phase transition for two percolation problems involving the Gaussian free field in 3D. 
  In one case, they determine a unique ``fixed point'' corresponding to the transition, which is proved 
  to obey one of several scaling relations. Such laws are classically conjectured to hold by physicists 
  on the grounds of a corresponding scaling ansatz.<br><br><br><br>

<li> November 24, 2021.<br><br> 

<b>Speaker</b>: Yair Shenfeld, MIT<br><br>

<b>Title</b>: Extremal structures in probability and convex geometry.<br/><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: What does a ball and a half space have in common? The former is the unique shape which minimizes
  surface area among all shapes of equal Euclidean volume, while the latter solves the analogous optimization problem 
  for Gaussian volume. These shapes are examples of extremal structures and they play a prominent role in geometric and 
  probabilistic phenomena: from the shape of water droplets to concentration of measure. Once we go deeper into the 
  world of extremal structures, we find that they seem hopelessly complex, while permeating mathematics, ranging 
  from probability to combinations to algebraic geometry. In fact, the characterization of some of these structures 
  is only conjectural, while for others, not even conjectures exist. I will talk about how we resolve several of these 
  conjectures using stochastic, analytic, and geometric tools.<br><br><br><br><br>
