<b>Title</b>: Extremal structures in probability and convex geometry.<br/><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: What does a ball and a half space have in common? The former is the unique shape which minimizes
  surface area among all shapes of equal Euclidean volume, while the latter solves the analogous optimization problem 
  for Gaussian volume. These shapes are examples of extremal structures and they play a prominent role in geometric and 
  probabilistic phenomena: from the shape of water droplets to concentration of measure. Once we go deeper into the 
  world of extremal structures, we find that they seem hopelessly complex, while permeating mathematics, ranging 
  from probability to combinations to algebraic geometry. In fact, the characterization of some of these structures 
  is only conjectural, while for others, not even conjectures exist. I will talk about how we resolve several of these 
  conjectures using stochastic, analytic, and geometric tools.<br/>

<b>Speaker</b>: Pierre-Francois Rodriguez, Imperial College, London.<br/><br/>

<b>Title</b>: Recent progress on near-critical percolation for the 3D Gaussian free field<br/><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: I will report on recent progress regarding the near-critical behavior of certain statistical 
  physics models in dimension 3. Our results deal with the critical scaling exponents associated to the 
  second-order phase transition for two percolation problems involving the Gaussian free field in 3D. 
  In one case, they determine a unique ``fixed point'' corresponding to the transition, which is proved 
  to obey one of several scaling relations. Such laws are classically conjectured to hold by physicists 
  on the grounds of a corresponding scaling ansatz.<br/>

<b>Speaker</b>: Konstantin Matetski, Columbia University <br/><br/>
 
<b>Title</b>: KPZ universality of random growing interfaces <br/><br/>

<b>Abstract</b>: The KPZ universality class includes random growing 
interfaces, which, after rescaling, are conjectured to converge to the
KPZ fixed point. The latter is a Markov process, which has been
characterized through the exact solution of TASEP, a particular model
in the class. The KPZ equation plays a special role and is conjectured
to be the only model connecting the Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) and
the KPZ fixed points. In the talk, I will introduce the KPZ fixed
point and review recent work on the KPZ universality done by myself
and my collaborators.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<b>Speaker:</b> Souvik Dhara, MIT <br/><br/>
 
<b>Title:</b> Fine structure of large networks: Universality phenomena,
asymptotic characterization, and modern issues<br/><br/>

<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will discuss some recent challenges arising
in the study of large and complex networks. Over the last decades,
improved data collection methods have significantly increased the
availability of empirical data on networks, and the study of networks
has become relevant across multiple disciplines such as biology,
computer science, physics, and statistics. This has stimulated
enormous activity in the mathematics research community to understand
(1) local and global structure of networks, (2) dynamic processes on
them, and (3) algorithms to discover hidden patterns in networks. In
this talk, I will discuss my research on the above three topics in the
context of percolation process, graph limits, and community detection
on networks. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

<b>Title:</b> Integrability of boundary Liouville CFT</br></br>

<b>Speaker:</b> Guillaume Remy, Columbia University</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Liouville theory is a fundamental example of a conformal 
field theory (CFT) first introduced in physics by A. Polyakov to describe
a canonical random 2d surface. In recent years it has been rigorously studied 
using probabilistic techniques. In this talk we will take a look at the 
integrable structure of Liouville CFT on a domain with boundary by proving 
exact formulas for its correlation functions. We will also discuss the connection 
with the conformal blocks of CFT which are fundamental functions determined by 
conformal invariance that underlie the exact solvability of CFT. Based on joint 
works with Morris Ang, Promit Ghosal, Xin Sun, Yi Sun and Tunan Zhu.</br></br>
